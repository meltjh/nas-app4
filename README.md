This is a To-Do List app.
By typing in a task and the 'Add' button or the Return key, the task is added to the list.

By swiping the task to the left, two buttons appear. By tapping 'Delete', the task is removed from the list.   
By tapping 'Check', the task is checked off. The text of the task is then struck through.
